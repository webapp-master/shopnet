				To - Do - List

			1
when i was at the ShippingScreen.js
I logged out

and then i was not redirect to the login page




			2

during registration
if i use email that is already in existence 

it gives a feedback that won't be understood by users   




			3

In registration and Login
make "username" to be unique
that is, no two user in the database can have same username



			4

after the user register
it redirects to the login page 

but i discover that inside the login page, the register button does not function 
also, if i didnt press the login page and i refresh the page just like that
it will login the user but it wont grant the authorization access token



			5

the placeholders in Sign up and Sign In
I want the text to be aligned center



			6

incorporate card body to encampsule the register form and login form



			7.
in the sign up page
'city' field ...... make it a drop down



			8.

inside "userActions.js"

export const login = (email, password) => async (dispatch) => {

edit 
email -------->  username



			9.

navigating from one page to another
I need to be able to use forward and backward arrow to navigate to previous page 



			10.


the next page I want to create is the BuyScreen.js
this page will have a buy button 





wallet balance:
product list: (it will list out the name of products I selected in the cart and )
No. of items:
Cost of products in your cart:
Shipping cost:
Tax:
Total amount:

above are the important  features that should be present in the BuyScreen.js
so, therefore with the aid of react bootstrap, design a suitable and beautiful  frontend page for BuySceen.js






			11.

once the user clicks this button, it will send all the data and info inside the redux state to the backend models.py
I want to call all the info and data I have saved inside the redux state
and create payload that will save all of this info inside the backend models.py 




			12.

Transaction history


			13.
wallet summary


			14

inside the BuyScreen.js
the shipping address display 

if the user adds "street" to his input while filling the form
i need you to remove it
that is, don't save the "street" inside the redux state 

I think you should tackle the problem from the "ShippingSceen.js"
while the user is still filling the form 
such that "street" won't be saved in the redux state
