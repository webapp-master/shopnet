				To - Do - List

			1
when i was at the ShippingScreen.js
I logged out

and the i was not redirect to the login page




			2

during registration
if i use email that is already in existence 

it gives a feedback that won't be understood by users   




			3

In registration and Login
make "username" to be unique
that is, no two user in the database can have same username



			4

after the user register
it redirects to the login page 

but i discover that inside the login page, the register button does not function 
also, if i didnt press the login page and i refresh the page just like that
it will login the user but it wont grant the authorization access token



			5

the placeholders in Sign up and Sign In
I want the text to be aligned center



			6

incorporate card body to encampsule the register form and login form



			7.
in the sign up page
'city' field ...... make it a drop down



			8.

inside "userActions.js"

export const login = (email, password) => async (dispatch) => {

edit 
email -------->  username



			9.

navigating from one page to another
I need to be able to use forward and backward arrow to navigate to previous page 



			10.


the next page I want to create is the BuyScreen.js
this page will have a buy button 





wallet balance:
product list: (it will list out the name of products I selected in the cart and )
No. of items:
Cost of products in your cart:
Shipping cost:
Tax:
Total amount:

above are the important  features that should be present in the BuyScreen.js
so, therefore with the aid of react bootstrap, design a suitable and beautiful  frontend page for BuySceen.js






			11.

once the user clicks this button, it will send all the data and info inside the redux state to the backend models.py
I want to call all the info and data I have saved inside the redux state
and create payload that will save all of this info inside the backend models.py 







I want to adjust the design you gave me 
I want the page to have one big card and card body
this card will have a header and footer
the header will have this text "Place your Order"
and the footer will have the "buy" button

inside the card body, here is the content;

wallet balance: $700
product list: AIRPODS WIRELESS BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES, CANNON EOS 80D DSLR CAMERA, IPHONE 11 PRO 256GB MEMORY
No. of items: 3
Cost of products in your cart: $523
Shipping cost:$7
Tax:$1
Total amount: $531

please note: you don't need to reference the redux store for any data
i just want a fronend design. later, i will replace each placeholder with the necessary state management logic
