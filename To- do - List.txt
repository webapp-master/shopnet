				To - Do - List

			1
when i was at the ShippingScreen.js
I logged out

and the i was not redirect to the login page




			2

during registration
if i use email that is already in existence 

it gives a feedback that won't be understood by users   




			3

In registration and Login
make "username" to be unique
that is, no two user in the database can have same username



			4

after the user register
it redirects to the login page 

but i discover that inside the login page, the register button does not function 
also, if i didnt press the login page and i refresh the page just like that
it will login the user but it wont grant the authorization access token



			5

the placeholders in Sign up and Sign In
I want the text to be aligned center



			6

incorporate card body to encampsule the register form and login form



			7.
in the sign up page
'city' field ...... make it a drop down



			8.

inside "userActions.js"

export const login = (email, password) => async (dispatch) => {

edit 
email -------->  username



			9.

navigating from one page to another
I need to be able to use forward and backward arrow to navigate to previous page 



			10.


the next page I want to create is the BuyScreen.js
this page will have a buy button 
once the user clicks this button, it will send all the data and info inside the redux state to the backend models.py




wallet
products
No. of items
Total amount

above are the important  features that should be present in the BuyScreen.js
so, therefore with the aid of react bootstrap, design a suitable frontend page for BuySceen.js
